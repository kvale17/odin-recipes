    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The word chilaquiles comes from the Nahuatl language, meaning chilis and greens. A traditional dish served in
        Mexico, the recipe hit the United States in 1898 when featured in The Spanish Cookbook, by Encarnación Pinedo.

    <p>At its most basic, chilaquiles consist of fried corn tortilla chips simmered in a brothy sauce. Not only is this
        dish affordable, but it’s also great for entertaining since both major components (the chips and the sauce) can
        be made in advance. Chilaquiles are also a great meatless option, and amazing for weeknights when you’re in need
        of a dish that’s ready in under 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying</li>
        <li>30 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn into strips</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 (7.75 ounce) can Mexican-style hot tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tortillas and onion in hot oil
            until crisp and golden brown, stirring frequently. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain the
            skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil.</li>
        <li>Place the skillet over medium heat. Return fried tortillas and onion to the skillet and stir in beaten eggs;
            season with salt. Cook and stir until eggs are firm
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce and water. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with
            cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted.
