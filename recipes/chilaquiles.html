    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The word chilaquiles comes from the Nahuatl language, meaning chilis and greens. A traditional dish served in
        Mexico, the recipe hit the United States in 1898 when featured in The Spanish Cookbook, by Encarnación Pinedo.

    <p>At its most basic, chilaquiles consist of fried corn tortilla chips simmered in a brothy sauce. Not only is this
        dish affordable, but it’s also great for entertaining since both major components (the chips and the sauce) can
        be made in advance. Chilaquiles are also a great meatless option, and amazing for weeknights when you’re in need
        of a dish that’s ready in under 30 minutes.</p>
